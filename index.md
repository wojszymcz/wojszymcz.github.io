*Welcome to my website*


I am a Researcher at [the Institute for Structural Research in Warsaw, Poland](https://ibs.org.pl/en/). My research interests lie in the intersection between education, labor economics, and applied econometrics, with a particular focus on the transition from education to the labor market.

<br/>
<b>In fall 2025, I will begin my PhD studies at Uppsala University.</b>
<br/>
I hold a degree in Econometrics from the University of Warsaw.
